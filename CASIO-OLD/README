---EO GPLNOTICE---



This program has the purpose of easing mathematical problems in situations in which you can only use a calculator that
doesn't supports CAS natively.

It is free to use.

It only uses standard c, so its easy to export it to other calculators. All it need's to be built it's the 
TUI(Text User Interface).

---File Info---
  arithmetic processor.c --> expression processor (input processor)
  poly.h --> polynomial code for 1 variable(x)
  fract.h --> fractions code
  matz.h --> some math expressions
  console.h --> console (calculator specific)
  MonochromeLib.h --> CASIO fx9860 lib
---EO File Info---

---Percentage Done---
  arithmetic processor.c --> 50%
  fract.h --> 100%
  poly.h --> 100%
  matz.h --> 100% (I'll just keep adding expressions as I need them)
---EO Percentage Done---

---Future Implementations---
  Symbolic -> To allow operations with symbols (such as pi, e, cos(x))
  Derivation -> To allow polynomial derivation and antiderivation
---EO Future Implementations---

---Working Calculators---
Already Released: FX-9860 SERIES (G, GII, GSD, GIISD)
future releases: TI's, Prizm, etc
Other Calculators: Just ask and contribute. That's why it's open source.
