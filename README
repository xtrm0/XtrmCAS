XtrmCAS
A simple yet powerful computer algebra system written in C.

The code is intended to be lightweight and fast, in order to be easy to port to calculators and other old devices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

The programming phases of the CAS are the following:
 1) Numeric calculations using integers
 2) Numeric calculation using big integers
 3) Numerical calculations using big rationals
 4) Numerical calculations using polynomes
 5) Numerical calculations using symbols/real numbers
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The code is centered around 3 main classes:
1) console - code that depends on the system
2) interpreter - code that reads the input
3) mathlibs - code that does the math and represents numbers and symbols

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Compiling using gcc:
gcc -Wall xtrmcas.c

Compiling in windows:
cl xtrmcas.c
